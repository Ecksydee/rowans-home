        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Some soldiers?</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">November 8, 2020 by <a>Rowan AKA Johan</a></p>

        <p>I’d been playing a bit of Conqueror’s Blade, which got me interested in gameplay that focused on small-scale utilization of troops more than anything else. The fine razor-walk between your soldiers being useless without you, and (as tends to be less common,) you being useless without your soldiers. So with that in mind, started doing some thinking of what the initial game moment of this would look like. 
        </p>
        <p>Right off the bat, a third person game would seem like it focuses more on the player, and less on positioning. So on a bored night I set up a quick isometric camera. 
          The camera is a relatively simple one. It does the following:
          </p>
          <ul>

            <li>Sets a focus Transform object, which is initialized to player.transform in Start.</li>
              <li>Stores distance, radius and centering variables for use later. These determine how far the Camera should be from the focus.</li>
              <li>Updates focus point, determines whether focus.position is different since last frame.</li>
              <li>Uses that to calculate where the camera should be.</li>
              <li>Vector3.Lerp() to smoothly transform camera.</li>
          </ul>


          <p>The result at the very least looks nice after a bit of tweaking in the variables.</p>

        <p>Next step is to start thinking of how to start dealing with this whole ‘soldier’ concept. 
          At the very least, here’s some design requirements for the Follower Controller. </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Be a singleton so it and the soldiers are easily accessible. There’s always one and only the player will use it.</li>
<li>For sake of simplicity, needs to store a GameObject for formation center, and formation target.</li>
<li>Needs to store an array of Vector3 which can be defined as a soldier instance’s ‘position’ in its formation. </li>
<li>Needs to use mouse commands to move and rotate this array of Vector3s. (Vector maths augh!)</li>
<li>Needs to store a list of GameObjects which implement Follower class (Which itself will store each follower instance’s health, position in formation etc.) and CharacterController component for Move function.</li>

<li>Use navmeshes at some point, but keep it simple for prototyping.</li>
<li>Implement some finite state machine for rotating, marching, charging, fighting, fleeing. Some inspiration from Total War series. </li>
<li>Models, animations, injuries, different abilities, different kinds of followers (Archers/soldiers/shields etc)</li>
<li>And probably a billion more things.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>First things first - implement singleton pattern. </p>

          <p>Stick in some fields</p>

          <img src="https://i.imgur.com/2H2XshA.png">

          <p>Make some methods</p>

          <img src="https://i.imgur.com/AuUuzPi.png">

          <p>RotPointsToMatchCenter just takes the array of Vector3s and orbits them X degrees around grid center point, where X is the angular difference between current formation center point rotation, and formation target, as follows:</p>

          <p>Simple enough to use OnDrawGizmos to debug the vectors.</p>

          <p>Once that’s done, it’s a simple enough deal to instantiate a list of gameobjects, stick a Follower item on them with some basic logic, and use CharacterController.move() on them, with a target of each follower’s unique position in the formation.</p>
